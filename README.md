# strings-and-pendulums
### strings:
forward and backward kinematic file contains a basic implementation of string simulation.
This Pygame script demonstrates a tentacle-like segmented object that follows the mouse cursor, along with a starfield simulation (currently commented out). The application showcases basic principles of physics and animation in Pygame.

Features
Segmented Tentacle: A chain of connected segments that follow the mouse cursor.
Starfield Simulation: Stars moving towards the screen center, creating a 3D effect (commented out in the main loop).

Controls
Mouse: The tentacle follows the mouse cursor.
A Key: Pauses the simulation for one second.
